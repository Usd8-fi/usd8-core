# USD8 — off-chain settlement computation

When a covered DeFi incident is opened, this computation produces the
claim-payout **merkle root**. In production it runs inside a TEE whose key
signs the result (EIP-712 `Settlement`, see `settlementTypedData` in
`compute.ts`), so anyone can submit it on-chain
(`DefiInsurance.settleIncident`) — the sole settlement path. The tool is fully
open-source and deterministic.

There is **no trusted operator and no special hardware**. Everything the
computation needs is read from chain state (the per-incident config,
reconstructed from contract state at the incident's `openBlock`; the on-chain
claim set; pool balances and prices), so **anyone can run it locally** to:

- **`compute`** — reproduce the settlement table, the merkle root, and each
  claimant's merkle proof; and
- **`verify`** — recompute independently and check that the root the admin
  submitted on-chain matches. If it doesn't, the root is wrong and can be
  disputed within the dispute window.

## Install

Requires Node.js 20+.

```bash
cd offchain
npm install
npm run build      # compiles src/ → dist/
```

## Configure

Edit `src/config.ts` with the deployed addresses and the per-asset USD price
feeds (the chain is locked to Ethereum mainnet — chain id 1 — and is not
configurable):

```ts
export const CONFIG = {
  registry:      "0x…",  // Registry (topology: pools, scored tokens, boosterNFT)
  defiInsurance: "0x…",  // DefiInsurance
  // Pool asset pricing is no longer on-chain: map each registered pool asset
  // (lowercased address) → its Chainlink-style USD feed. Every pool asset needs one.
  assetUsdFeed: { "0xa0b8…eb48": "0x8fff…f6" }, // e.g. USDC → USDC/USD feed
};
```

Set `RPC_URL` to any **archive** node for mainnet (archive is required — the
tool reads historical state at the incident's window-end block; its chain id is
verified against 1 at startup):

```bash
export RPC_URL="https://…"
```

## Run

```bash
# Verify the admin's submitted root for incident 1 (the common case):
npm run verify 1
#   → prints the recomputed table + root, the on-chain root, and MATCH / MISMATCH.
#     Exit code 0 on match, 1 on mismatch.

# Reproduce the full settlement, including per-claim merkle proofs:
npm run compute 1
```

`compute` prints, per claim, the exact `(amounts, scoreSpent, proof)` a
claimant passes to `DefiInsurance.finalizeClaim`. It also publishes the
canonical, address-sorted `(user, grossEarnedScore)` rows and their
`settlementInputHash`; this is the per-incident input commitment included in
the TEE's EIP-712 signature.

## What it computes (all from chain state)

1. **Rebuild the claimant table** by replaying `ClaimRegistered` /
   `ClaimCancelled` events in true chain order. The live-claim count is bound
   into the TEE settlement signature (`Incident.unresolved`), pinning the exact
   set that was scored.
2. **Pre-incident value**: TWAP the insured token→underlying ratio over a
   window ending at the incident's `referenceBlock`, times the underlying's
   USD price at the window-end block.
3. **Per claim**: the continuous **minimum balance** of the insured token held
   over `[referenceBlock − holdingMargin, joinBlock − 1]` (which also dedupes
   across claimants), capped at the escrow → eligible amount → `lossUsd`. The
   window runs up to the block *before* the claim's `joinClaim` (which escrows
   the token out of the wallet), so the escrow itself never reduces it, yet the
   claimant must have held continuously from before the incident right up to
   filing. The loss is still **priced** at the pre-incident `referenceBlock`.
4. **Score**: each holder's earned insurance score **as of `referenceBlock`**
   (token·block integral of the scored tokens, plus committed boosters — capped
   at the claimant's min booster balance over `[joinBlock, windowEnd]`), minus
   already-spent score summed from `ScoreSpent` logs (pinned before `openBlock`),
   capped to what the claim requested → `scoreSpent` (the payout weight). Pinning
   to `referenceBlock` stops anyone farming fresh score during the claim window.
5. **Payout**: `min(scoreShare × poolUsd, κ × lossUsd)`, split per pool
   pro-rata to the pool mix, aligned to `Registry.pools()` at `openBlock`.
6. **Merkle root**: OZ `StandardMerkleTree` over
   `(incidentId, claimId, user, amounts, scoreSpent, eligibleAmount)` — the exact leaf
   encoding `finalizeClaim` verifies with `bytes32[] proof`.

Phase 1 obtains gross score through `RpcScoreSource`, which preserves the exact
raw historical-RPC replay. The payout computation depends only on the
`ScoreSource` interface, so a future indexed snapshot can replace the transport
without changing score arithmetic, payout math, or the canonical signed input
rows.

All tunable parameters (coverage κ, TWAP/holding windows, the conversion recipe,
the underlying oracle, the scored-token set) are read from contract state at the
incident's `openBlock`, not hard-coded here — so two people running this at
different times get the identical root. Only the per-asset pool-valuation feeds
(`assetUsdFeed`) live in `config.ts`.

## Tests

Two layers:

```bash
# 1. Unit tests — the settlement algorithm (payout math, score/booster cap,
#    merkle encoding) over stubbed chain reads. Fast, no RPC.
npm test

# 2. Cross-language integration — drives a real incident in Foundry, then uses
#    THIS package (via FFI) to produce the root / proofs and proves they
#    settle and pay each claimant exactly the off-chain amounts. Requires the
#    build artifacts and is opt-in:
npm run build
cd .. && RUN_INTEGRATION=1 forge test --offline --ffi --match-path test/SettlementIntegration.t.sol -vv
```

The integration test is skipped by a plain `forge test` (no `--ffi`, no env), so
it never breaks the default Solidity suite.

## Layout

```
src/config.ts    contract addresses + per-asset USD feeds (the only thing to edit; chain locked to mainnet)
src/chain.ts     read-only RPC helpers (events, prices, balances, config)
src/compute.ts   the settlement algorithm (pure, given the chain reads)
src/score.ts     ScoreSource abstraction + Phase-1 raw-RPC implementation
src/ffi.ts       FFI bridge used by the Foundry integration test
src/main.ts      the compute / verify CLI
test/            Vitest unit tests
```
